An iframe based Shadow DOM poorlyfill


### Features

  * compatible down to **IE9** with a size of about 1.3K
  * provides an `element.attachShadow(mode)` method out of the box
  * both mode `open` and `closed` are available. `open` is set to the `shadowRoot` property as expected
  * events are synthetically re-targeted to the owner, hence propagated to the parent document
  * encapsulation is preserved, including `:host` CSS declarations
  * each _iframe_ transparently resizes accordingly to its content

### Missing

  * the `<slot>` element <small>(under consideration)</small>
  * if you `shadowRoot.innerHTML = "<p onclick='console.log(0)'></p>"` DOM Level 0 events won't ever propagate (inconsistent with real Shadow DOM, just don't do that or simply use [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML) instead that will use `addEventListener`)

```js
hyperHTML(el.shadowRoot)
  `<p onclick=${() => console.log('ðŸŽ‰')}></p>`;
```

### What this is not

  * this is not a Custom Elements or an HTMLTemplateElement polyfill. This is only the `attachShadow` method.
  * this is not, and never could be, a 100% fully standard Shadow DOM polyfill, for the simple reason that Shadow DOM cannot be polyfilled (this is _a poorlyfill_ indeed, with its caveats and compromises)
  * not yet a battle tested solution. If you have any experience with _iframe_ shenanigans please help making this poorlyfill less poor, thank you!

### CDN

### Test

Please visit the [test page](https://webreflection.github.io/attachshadow/test/) and click on the button to see in console the propagated event in IE9 or any other browser.

You can also test more modern browsers in this [good old CSS Tricks demo](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/goNNwZ?editors=0010).
